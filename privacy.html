    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>
    
    <h2>The Short Version</h2>
    <p>WanderMap doesn't store your GPS coordinates. It stores road segment IDs (like "174247412_10_17") that represent which roads you've traveled on. Segment IDs can optionally sync to a global community map, anonymously.</p>
    
    <h2>What We Store</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Road segment identifiers (codes for which roads you've traveled)</li>
        <li>Segment lengths (for distance calculations)</li>
        <li>Administrative regions (city, county, state, country)</li>
        <li>App settings</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What We Don't Store</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>GPS coordinates or location history</li>
        <li>Timestamps of when you visited places</li>
        <li>Personal identifying information</li>
        <li>Travel patterns or routes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How Detection Works</h2>
    <p>Your GPS location is compared against OpenStreetMap roads to identify which segments you travel. GPS coordinates are used momentarily for detection, then discarded. Only the segment ID is saved.</p>
    
    <h2>Global Exploration Map</h2>
    <p>WanderMap contributes to a community map showing which roads have been explored worldwide. When you explore a road, the segment ID and an anonymous device hash are uploaded. Nothing else. The hash counts unique visitors and is deleted after daily aggregation.</p>
    <p>Your contributions can't be traced back to you. Imported segments are not synced to prevent inflating visit counts.</p>
    <p>You can disable this by turning on Offline Mode in settings. You'll still see the global map, but your explorations won't be uploaded.</p>
    
    <h2>Bug Reports</h2>
    <p>Bug reports are optional and may include recent GPS data to help diagnose issues. You can review the data before submitting. Reports are auto-deleted after 90 days.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Control</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Export your data anytime as a JSON file</li>
        <li>Delete all data with one button in settings</li>
        <li>Use Privacy Mode to view history without GPS tracking</li>
        <li>Use Offline Mode to stop contributing to the global map</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally using Android's secure storage. Since we don't collect personal location data, there's nothing to leak.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploration data is stored until you delete it</li>
        <li>Bug reports are auto-deleted after 90 days</li>
        <li>Visitor hashes are deleted after daily aggregation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>WanderMap doesn't require an account or login. We have no way to identify you.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>WanderMap is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
    
    <h2>Map Data</h2>
    <p>Road data comes from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> under the <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">Open Database License</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy occasionally. Significant changes will be announced in the app.</p>
